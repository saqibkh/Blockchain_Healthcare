# Pet-Shop-Tutorial
Example for building an application on Ethereum

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum has well maintained up-to-date tools and tutorials which help to make my life easier. The Petshop tutorial will teach you how to write a smart contract, use ganache to create a private ethereum instance, deploy a smart contract, and use a web3 interface to interact with your application. The Pet tutorial can be found here:

# Connecting to Infura
Infura is a service which provides a RESTful interface to the Ethereum blockchain. Once you have run through the petshop tutorial successfully, move your application from your blockchain to the Ropstien testnet.
